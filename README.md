# Machine-Learning-A-Z
Exercises from taking Udemy online course - Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-on Python & R in Data Science excluding the deep learning part. The notes cover what I learnt from the online courses about machine learning models' deployment on Python.

The repository includes a Python_notes.ipynb to list the important take-aways from this course, and all the R data modeling and visualization templates that can be directly adopted:
### Regression in Python and R
* Simple Linear Regression
* KNN in Python and R
* Decision Tree & Random Forest in Python and R
* K means in Python and R
* Principle Component Analysis(PCA) in Python and R
* Tensorflow in Python and R

# Machine-Learning-A-Z
Exercises from taking Udemy online course - Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-on Python & R in Data Science excluding the deep learning part. The notes cover what I learnt from the online courses about machine learning models' deployment on Python.

The repository includes a Python_notes.ipynb to list the important take-aways from this course, and all the R data modeling and visualization templates that can be directly used:
### Regression in R
* Simple Linear Regression
* Polynomial Linear Regression
* Multi-Linear Regression
* Support Vector Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
* Random Forest Regression

### Classification in R
* Logistic Regression 
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machine
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier


* K means in Python and R
* Principle Component Analysis(PCA) in Python and R
* Tensorflow in Python and R
